		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Event Listings</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>As a Member, you may create listings for Events as the Host of that Event by answering various questions about the Event, including, but not limited to, the location, cancellation policy, pricing, menu items, and special requests for the guests. You warrant that all answers to the questions are accurate descriptions of the event. By opening the Event, the event must have a valid physical address. Events will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to request a seat at your Event as a Guest via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Event. When you create an Event you may choose to include in the “Request for Guests” section certain requirements, which must be met by the Guests in order to request a seat at the Event. You understand and agree that once a Guest requests a seat at your event, the price and terms for such event may not be altered.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any and all Events you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Event you post and the seating of Guests for a Event you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties and (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to anything provided in a Event you post, including, but not limited to, zoning laws, health laws, license laws and any other applicable laws governing properties and food and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties.</div>

		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>You understand and agree that Local Yum does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for, or representative of, you as a Host. If a Guest requests a seat at your Event and consumes your meal provided at such Event, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Local Yum is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Local Yum serves as the limited authorized agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Host and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Host.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Events at your request or invitation, excluding the Guests who are attending with a seat confirmed and paid for through Local Yum. It is highly recommended that you, as the Host, list the ingredients that are used to make the meal so that Guests can review them to ensure they are not allergic to any before requesting seats. </div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Local Yum recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Events. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Event carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of Guests while at your Event.</div>

		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Financial Terms for Hosts</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Local Yum does not charge any fees for the posting of Event. </div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>If you are a Host and a seat is requested for your Event via the Site, Application and Services, you will be required to either confirm or reject the request. If you choose to confirm the seat request, the guest will be notified to pay for the seat at the seat price you set for this event and it will count towards your earnings. A “seating fee” of 5% of the seat price will be deducted from your earnings. </div>
			
			<!-- <div class = 'margin_bottom'>If you choose to contribute a certain percentage of your earnings for an Event as the Host to charity, Local Yum will withhold that amount for you and contribute directly to the charity on a semi-annual basis. In addition, Local Yum will match the percentage you contribute to charity in respective to the “seating fees” Local Yum has collected for the guests that attended your event. For example, if your event is $100 per seat and you choose to donate 50% to charity, Local Yum will withhold $45 for you to contribute directly to charity in your name, $45 will be your earnings that count towards your balance available for withdraw, and Local Yum will collect $10 “seating fee” of which $5 will be contributed to charity from Local Yum. Local Yum reserves the right, at any time, to change the frequency of the charity contributions without any prior notice. </div> -->

Local Yum reserves the right, at any time, to change the frequency of the charity contributions without any prior notice. </div>

			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Local Yum will not withhold any of your earnings other than the “seating fee” and charity contributions. As a Host, you understand and agree to accurately calculate your seat price to reflect any additional costs or taxes that you need to withhold for every seat booked. You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining your applicable Tax reporting requirements in consultation with your tax advisors. Local Yum cannot and does not offer Tax-related advice to any Members of the Site, Application and Services. Additionally, please note that each Host is responsible for determining local indirect Taxes and for including any applicable Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to applicable Taxes in the seat pricing. </div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>All of the earnings from Events, minus applicable charity contributions, fees and penalties, will be available for withdraw from your account balance 48 hours after the Event’s scheduled start time. If a paid Guest opened a dispute for this event within 48 hours after the Event’s scheduled start time, the earnings from that Event will not be available for withdraw until the Guest removes his or her dispute. In the event of a dispute, we will contact the Guest and you directly in good faith to further understanding and help resolve the dispute. You understand and agree that Local Yum is not a party in this dispute and will not be responsible for this dispute. Local Yum is only here to try and help resolve this dispute quickly. If a dispute cannot be resolved easily, you will have to settle this dispute with the Guest directly without any Local Yum involvement. You hereby release Local Yum of any responsibility, accountability, or involvement for any dispute between a Host and a Guest.</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Hosts can choose to either transfer their account balance via ACH direct deposit with no fee or Paypal with a fee of $5 plus 10% of transfer amount. If the ACH direct deposit transfer is rejected due to invalid information, the Host will be charged a penalty of $2 per failure of transfer.</div>
		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Financial Terms for Guests</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>The Hosts, not Local Yum, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed seating and hosting the promised event reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of a seat at the Host’s Event, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Event imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Local Yum, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, and Local Yum is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Local Yum disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements. </div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>If the Host confirms your seat request, your seat will not be considered completely confirmed and secured unless you pay for the price of the seat plus the “servicing fee” of $2 or 5% of the seat price, which ever is higher. You agree to pay Local Yum for the price of the seat and the “servicing fee” of seat requested if the Host confirms such request. Please note that Local Yum cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Local Yum’s collection of the price of the seat and “servicing fee”, and Local Yum disclaims all liability in this regard.</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>In connection with your requested seat booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card information either to Local Yum or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Local Yum for any confirmed seat bookings made in connection with your Local Yum Account in accordance with these Terms by credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of securing the booking, either directly by Local Yum or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. Once your confirmed seat booking transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.</div>
		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Cancellations</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>If the host cancels an event, 100% of seat price as well as “servicing fee” will be refunded to the guest. The host will be charge a penalty of $1 per refunded guest and 10% of refunded amount. This penalty will be deducted from the host’s account earnings balance.</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>If the guest cancels a seat request before the seat is secured with a payment, no charges will be made. If the guest cancels a seat request by withdrawing from the Event after the seat has been confirmed and secured with a payment, refund to the Guest will be provided in accordance with the applicable cancellation policy selected by the Host for the Event and reflected in the relevant Event posting. </div>

		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>These Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia and the United States of America, without regard to its conflict-of-law provisions. You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a court located in Washington, D.C. or a United States District Court, Washington, D.C. for any actions for which the parties retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>In the event a dispute arises between you and Local Yum, please contact Local Yum.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>You and Local Yum agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the Site (including, but not limited to, any services provided or made available therein) or this Agreement must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action arose; otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>You and Local Yum agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, or to the use of the Site or Services (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Local Yum are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Further, unless both you and Local Yum otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this “Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this “Dispute Resolution” section will survive any termination of these Terms.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at http://www.adr.org/arb_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org/si.asp?id=3477 and a separate form for District residents at http://www.adr.org/.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the District of Columbia and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Local Yum otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Local Yum submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. </div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules.
