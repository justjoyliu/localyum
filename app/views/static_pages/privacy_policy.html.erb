	<div class = 'margin_top'>Last Updated: September 1, 2013 </div>

	<div class = 'margin_top'>Local Yum, LLC. ("Local Yum", "we" or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of www.localyum.com (the "Site") and our application for mobile devices (the "Application"). This Privacy Policy applies only to information that you provide to us through the Site and Application. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your Local Yum Account) or update the last update date at the top of this page. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our <%= link_to "Terms of Service", terms_path %>.</div>

	<div class = 'margin_top'>As used in this policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our affiliates within the United States or internationally.</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>International Transfer</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>YOUR INFORMATION MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO - AND MAINTAINED ON - COMPUTERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF YOUR STATE, PROVINCE, COUNTRY OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION WHERE THE PRIVACY LAWS MAY NOT BE AS PROTECTIVE AS THOSE IN YOUR JURISDICTION. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND CHOOSE TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO US, LOCAL YUM TRANSFERS PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROCESSES IT THERE. YOUR CONSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY FOLLOWED BY YOUR SUBMISSION OF SUCH INFORMATION REPRESENTS YOUR AGREEMENT TO THAT TRANSFER.</div>
	</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Information Collection and Use</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Site, Application, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and Application (together, the "Service") and to enable users to enjoy and easily navigate the Site and Application.</div>
	</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Personally Identifiable Information</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>When you register with us through the Site or Application and become a Member and when you choose to post an Event or book a seat at an Event, or when you wish to contact another Member, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Identity Information"). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number, email address, social security number (SSN), and home postal address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. In order to process some of your transactions through the Site and Application, we may also ask for your credit card number and other billing information ("Billing Information") (Identity Information and Billing Information together, "Personal Information"). If the address of an Event you post matches that of your credit card billing address, that address would be considered Identity Information. In order to transfer your Event earnings to you, we will also collect your bank account number and routing number, bank account name, or PayPal account email address, billing address and other financial information in order to complete this transaction. Some Personal Information is required, like your name and email address, and other Personal Information is optional, like your date of birth. We reserve the right to require address confirmation for Events included in posting. If we require such confirmation, we will send a code via postal mail to the address contained in an Event posting and ask you to enter the code via the Site, Application and Service in order to confirm the address of the Event included in the applicable Listing. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join the Service. You can register to join via the Site or Application by completing the required forms.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Local Yum Account profile (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying Information").</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your demographic information). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Local Yum Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site, Application and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Local Yum newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "Notifications" information. (See "Changing or Deleting Information," below.) Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications.</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Log Data</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>When you visit the Site and Application, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an "Local Yum User"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site and Application, pages of our Site and Application that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site and Application, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site, Application and the Service and for the Site and Application's technical administration, to increase our Site and Application's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site and Application to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Cookies</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes. First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site and Application. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site and Application, to better understand how you interact with the Site and Application and to monitor aggregate usage by Local Yum Users and web traffic routing on the Site and Application. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site, Application and Service and then close your browser. Third party advertisers on the Site and Application may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site or Application or all functionality of the Service.</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Web Beacons</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Our Site and Application may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and Application are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Emailing Via an Local Yum Account</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>As part of the Service, Local Yum Users may communicate with Local Yum Members through use of the "Contact Host" feature on the Site and Application. Where Local Yum Users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Local Yum to those email addresses on their behalf. These email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. </div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>If you choose to use our recommend or referral service to ask a friend to attend an Event or for a recommendation, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Local Yum stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.</div>
	</div>

	<div class = 'padding_top_30px margin_bottom_20px'>
		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Phishing</div>
		<div class = 'margin_bottom'>Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Local Yum. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Local Yum Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov.</div>

		<div class = 'font_bold font_18px margin_bottom'>Information Sharing and Disclosure</div>
		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Overview</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>The Site, Application and Service can be used to facilitate the listing and seat booking of Events. Listings for such Events are made available via the Site, Application and Service by Hosts. Listings posted by Hosts, ratings and reviews of Hosts and Guests, and the Profile Information (as defined below) of Hosts and Guests, are visible to any Local Yum User.</div>
		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Local Yum Members and Users</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>When you create a Local Yum Account, we will set up a Local Yum Account profile page for you. Your Local Yum Account profile page will include your first name and last initial. You can select the other items of Personal Information that you wish to be included in your Local Yum Account profile (together, your "Profile Information"). We will display your Profile Information in your Local Yum Account profile page publicly via the Site and Application, and, with your prior permission, on third party sites. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile Information will be publicly visible to all Local Yum Users and consequently should reflect how much you want other Local Yum Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your Profile Information at any time.</div>
		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Event Listings</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>If you post an Event, we may publish that Listing publicly via the Site and Application and may enable third parties to publish your Listing on their websites through the use of an HTML "widget". We may also display the geographical location of your Listing in the form of a map so that potential Guests can see the general area and neighborhood of your Listing, but your actual street address will not be disclosed until you enter into a confirmed transaction with another Member.</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>If you request to make a seat request via the Site, Application and Service, Local Yum will share the following information about you with the applicable Host: your first and last name and a link to your Local Yum Account profile page. All of this information will enable the Host to decide whether to confirm or reject your request. When a Host confirms a seat request, we will share pieces of the Host’s Identify Information, including, but not limited to, contact information and Event address, with the applicable Guest selected by the Host. In no event is a Guest's Billing Information shared with a Host.</div>
		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information and Log Data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.</div>
		<div class = 'padding_top margin_bottom font_bold font_16px'>Service Providers</div>
			<div class = 'margin_bottom'>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site and Application-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, fraud detection services relating to the activity of Local Yum Users and improvement of the Site and Application's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site, Application and Service are used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information; if they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. We may also provide Personal Information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a Local Yum User's prior visits to Local Yum.
